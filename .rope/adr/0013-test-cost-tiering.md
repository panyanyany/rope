# 0013 Test-Cost Tiering — Impact Before Suite Size

**Status:** active — amends the original full-suite frequency policy by user
confirmation in `dynamic-docs-and-clear/quick.md`. Completes
[0009](0009-ticket-tdd-issue-bdd-layering.md), refines
[0011](0011-edge-classification-and-acceptance-gates.md), and preserves
[0007](0007-graph-driven-go-single-review.md)'s single review gate and
[0008](0008-slice-ready-worktree-execution.md)'s avoidance of merge rituals.

## Context

Agent-workbench MR 57 collected 18 per-slice full-suite verification entries.
Repeated full discovery, lost piped verdicts, and parallel CPU contention
amplified reruns. Later dynamic instructions turned the intended upper bound
into “exactly twice,” contradicting baseline reuse and running unrelated
suites by phase rather than impact. A phase is not evidence of a dependency.

## Decision

1. Select tests by affected behavior, shared consumers, and uncertainty.
   Slice TDD is focused; integration checks cover affected seams; final review
   walks issue behavior at the real entrypoint. Expand to broad suites when
   shared infrastructure, unknown impact, observed coupling, or explicit repo
   requirements justify it. Record the reason in Testing Decisions.
2. Full suites remain **issue-level evidence**, never per-slice requirements.
   Baseline and final review are selection points, not mandatory executions.
   Local backend changes do not automatically require all frontend tests;
   changed backend/UI contracts include their affected consumers.
3. Reuse applicable same-HEAD green baseline evidence; otherwise select quick
   or affected tests, escalating by impact. Preserve scope and environment
   limits: green for a subset is not green for the whole repo. Store output
   and exit status once, then parse stored evidence.
4. Keep the `routes.md` Test tiers contract and automatic quick-tier derivation.
   Operational criteria, budgets, and the baseline ladder live only in the
   shipped [execution rules](../../skills/rope-go/references/execution-rules.md).
5. Under parallel-load failures, diagnose/rerun the failing tests first.
   Broader reruns need a recorded impact reason. Missing evidence returns to
   the leaf, not a parent backfill or a silent substitute verification.

## Consequences

- Full-suite work no longer grows with slice count or runs to satisfy a quota.
- Focused evidence can discover unrelated failures later; acceptance remains
  honest about its scope. Uncertain impact expands coverage conservatively.
- Teams with explicit all-suite requirements retain them; Rope does not
  override repository policy to save time.
- No cache service or test-selection runtime is introduced. Repo commands and
  the accepted behavior remain the inputs to agent judgment.

## Addendum (2026-09-11): the check timetable, evidence reuse, and the repo policy field

ADR 0013's selection rules were correct and were still violated in practice for
a mechanical reason: nothing carried them into execution. The first production
dynamic run spent ~11 full-suite executions (~38 of 73 minutes), and the
audited follow-up ran its integration gate on a checkout with **nothing merged**.
Both are now executor mechanism rather than advice.

### Decision

1. **Checks are declared data with a stage**, not prose in a script:
   `merge` (cheap post-merge warning), `l2`, `l3`, `freeze`. The parent compiles
   them from `routes.md`'s `Test tiers` and the repo's policy; the kernel runs
   each stage's batch through `scripts/run-check.sh` as the host's gate, so the
   verdict is an exit code rather than an agent's report.
2. **Reuse is keyed**, by `<scope>@<integrated commit set>`. An unchanged state
   finds its evidence file and does not spend the command again; changed scope
   or a new commit invalidates it. Every stage batch runs after the dispatch
   loop has drained, so no check ever runs beside a leaf: `stage: "merge"`
   checks are declared cheap because they precede L2, not because they overlap
   anything.
3. **`routes.md` gains `Test policy:`** — the repository's own declaration of
   `fast-iteration` (impact-selected only) or `full-at-freeze` (this repo
   requires its full suite at the freeze point). It is the repo's statement, not
   a judgement call at go; an absent line is legal and the impact ladder decides.
   Shape records the value in Testing Decisions.
4. **Missing evidence is never backfilled by the parent.** A gate's detail lives
   in the evidence file beside its output; the parent reads it, and a missing
   slice evidence item bounces the leaf (ADR 0011 Return Gate), unchanged.

### Consequences

- "Full is a scope, not a frequency" is now enforced by an artifact rather than
  remembered by a session: a repeated expensive command requires deleting
  evidence or changing the key.
- Evidence lives in the tree beside the issue package
  (`.rope/issues/<slug>/evidence/`). Two mechanisms keep it from being read as
  work: the delivery gate is invoked with `--evidence` and excludes that path
  from both its cleanliness check and its leftover-recovery commit, and the
  repository declares one ignore line so a human's `git status` and a leaf's
  `git add -A` stay honest. Discovery beats hiding: `.git/rope-evidence/` was
  the first answer, and it read as a location chosen to dodge a check rather
  than as a place for a record.
- A check that only a human can run stays out of `checks` and stays visible in
  E2E as `blocked_on_user`.

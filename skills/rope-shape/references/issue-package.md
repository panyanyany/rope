# <Issue Title>

## Problem Statement

<User-facing problem.>

## Solution

<User-facing solution.>

## Contract Note

- <3–5 one-sentence bullets: when this issue is done, what can you observe? Include failure visibility where relevant. Direct projection of Behavior Contract — not a separate wish list.>

## Goals

- <goal>

## Non-goals

- <non-goal>

## Public Interface / Behavior

- <callable API, UI behavior, CLI, config, schema, side effect, or observable result>

## Testing Decisions

- Good test: observe external behavior at agreed seams — not implementation details
- Seams under test: <list confirmed with user during shape; when placement is contested, argue it with [seam-design.md](seam-design.md)>
- Prior art (optional): <paths or patterns of similar tests in-repo>
- Test scope: <affected modules/consumers, selected commands, excluded suites and reasons>
- Contract sweep (only when the issue retires or re-keys a contract): <the vocabulary grepped across the test tree, the files it hit, and which hits are migrated in-issue versus named out of scope with a reason>
- Broader-suite trigger: <impact/uncertainty/repo requirement, or none; apply [test selection](../../rope-go/references/execution-rules.md#test-tiers--baseline-ladder-repo-contract-adr-0013)>
- Repo suite policy: <`fast-iteration` | `full-at-freeze` — copied from `routes.md`'s `Test policy:` line; say `undeclared` when the repo has none, and the impact ladder decides>

## Behavior Contract

- System under test: <behavior being specified and tested>
- Trigger/input: <user action, API call, event, command, or state change>
- Collaborators: <dependencies that participate but do not own the behavior>
- Observable result: <output, state, artifact, UI, log, or side effect proving success>  <!-- each Contract Note bullet must project from this / Failure visibility -->
- Failure visibility: <where and how errors are visible>
- Forbidden shortcuts: <implementation paths that would violate intent>

## Architecture Impact

- Impact: required | not-applicable

- Forbidden out-of-scope actions: <actions that require renewed approval>

# <Issue Title> Tasks

Execution mode: worktree | shared   # probed at shape (ADR 0012); go consumes, may degrade with recorded reason

## Graph summary

<Report what the executor compiled, not hand arithmetic: initial ready count,
level widths, longest gating chain, and the cross-level preference edges. A
chain of n levels is n sequential rounds whatever the window is.>

## Behavior Matrix (issue behavior spec — BDD)

| Behavior (Given/When/Then where it helps) | Applies? | Verified at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary path | yes/no | ticket TDD / end-of-issue review |
| Alternate input or entrypoint | yes/no | ticket TDD / review |
| Empty or missing input | yes/no | ticket TDD |
| Invalid or malformed input | yes/no | ticket TDD |
| Unavailable or not-ready dependency | yes/no | ticket TDD |
| Duplicate or idempotent case | yes/no | ticket TDD |
| Boundary or limit case | yes/no | ticket TDD |
| Existing behavior compatibility | yes/no | review |
| Real-entrypoint behavior (real API/env semantics) | yes/no | e2e.md + review probe |

## Slice 1: <Title>

- Status: pending
- Kind: vertical | contract | wide-refactor-expand | wide-refactor-migrate | wide-refactor-contract
- Goal: <user-perspective end-to-end result this slice makes true — not a layer list>
- Demo path: <the behavior you can demo when this slice lands — never a layer name>
- Blocked by: none | Slice N, … (<each edge labeled: file-overlap | seam-required | methodology-order>)
- Scope: <path/area bounds; disjoint from sibling slices when parallel/dynamic>
- Owned files: <explicit files this slice owns; unique within a shared-mode wave — in recorded worktree mode overlap is legal and expressed by a file-overlap edge (ADR 0012)>
- Size cap: <default ~400 diff lines or ~4 owned files; exceeded ⇒ split>
- Matrix rows:
- Constraint IDs: <decision/invariant IDs owned by this slice>
- Required evidence: <evidence for those IDs — each entry cites the matrix row(s) it proves; a matrix row with no slice evidence is a shape defect>
- Public behavior: <one user-visible sentence of what works when this slice is done>
- Tests:
- Implementation notes:
- Verification: <focused seam tests + guards this slice can affect — never a full-suite run (ADR 0013)>
- Stop conditions:
```

### Composition roots block (when touched ≥1 — ADR 0014)

```md
## Composition roots

- <root file/module, e.g. dingtalk_stream_assembly> — L3: real assembly +
  fake outer-boundary transport, one event in (<event>) → observable out
  (<assertion>); harness: <existing harness path | Slice N harness slice>
- <root 2> — …
```

Size cap is universal (fresh-context fit); slices that cannot fit are re-cut
at shape, never shipped oversized.

`Verification` granularity (ADR 0013): default is **focused** — the seam
tests and guards the slice can affect, seconds not minutes. The full
suite is an **issue-level** gate (go baseline fallback, end-of-issue
assembly); writing it into a slice makes every leaf pay for the whole
issue. A behavior-preservation refactor that needs the full net records
the reason in Testing Decisions and the net runs at issue level, not per
slice.

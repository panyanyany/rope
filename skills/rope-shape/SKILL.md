# Rope Shape

Parent Orchestrator: turn a clarified requirement into an **issue package**
(`.rope/issues/<slug>/{prd,tasks,e2e}.md`). Not a `.rope/specs/` architecture
doc — keep **issue / PRD / slice** vocabulary.

Templates: [references/issue-package.md](references/issue-package.md).
Seam placement vocabulary: [references/seam-design.md](references/seam-design.md).
Architecture impact and Constraint Bundle: [references/architecture-continuity.md](references/architecture-continuity.md).
E2E classes, gates, vocab, wide-refactor: [references/gates-and-vocab.md](references/gates-and-vocab.md).

Default handoff: same-session `rope-go`.

## Workflow

1. Before shaping, read **Startup** in the installed
   [dynamic workflow reference](../rope-go/references/dynamic-workflow.md);
   reuse the session's resolution or resolve it on direct entry. Under
   `dynamic`, read **Grill / shape** there before research and slicing.
   Read CONTEXT, routes, architecture continuity, and relevant adr/research/specs.
2. Inspect only enough for public interfaces and verification **seams** (explore leaf if wide).
   Seed `<issue>/map.md` from what exploration learned — one fact per line, each
   with a file path and a date. Later leaves read the map for orientation and
   update the lines they falsify.
   **Worktree-setup check (incremental):** if `routes.md` has no
   `Worktree setup:` line, ask the user how a fresh worktree becomes
   testable — prefer a **check-first idempotent script** (cheap no-op when
   already testable; read-only symlinks / shared caches over reinstalling),
   or `host-managed` — and record the answer in `routes.md`. Existing
   repos join the worktree mode here without re-running `rope-init`.
   **Test-tiers check (ADR 0013):** if `routes.md` has no `Test tiers:`
   line, derive one now per the go execution-rules contract (fixed
   criteria, timed budget) and write it back with the derivation
   note — zero-human; existing repos join here like worktree-setup. Beside
   it, record the repo's **broader-suite policy** (`Test policy: fast-iteration`
   = impact-selected only, or `full-at-freeze` = the repo requires its full
   suite at the freeze point). It is the repository's declaration, not a
   judgement call at go; missing is legal and means the ladder decides.
   **Execution-mode probe (ADR 0012):** verify whether this harness can
   spawn an isolated (worktree) subagent, and record the result in the
   `tasks.md` header as `Execution mode: worktree` | `shared` (one line on
   how verified). Go consumes it; a capability mismatch at go degrades to
   shared with a recorded reason. This isolation probe is separate from
   step 1's execution-form resolution. Apply the dynamic reference's
   coverage and width checks at step 9.
3. Run the conditional Architecture Impact trigger check. Record `required`, or
   `not-applicable` with the lightweight check. For `required`, list each source,
   status, disposition, invariant, forbidden shortcut, evidence, scope, and conflict.
   If no source is found, record a risk-reviewed New decision candidate.
4. **Confirm seams and architecture dispositions** with the user when a high-risk
   candidate, supersede, exception, or unresolved conflict needs a decision.
5. **Slice outline quiz:** title, user-visible delivery, `Blocked by`, matrix
   rows, constraint IDs, evidence → iterate until approved → then
   write full files.
6. Write `prd.md` (problem/solution, goals/non-goals, **Contract Note**, Behavior Contract, public
   behavior, **Testing Decisions**, Architecture Impact, full Constraint Bundle,
   refs, gates).
7. Behavior Matrix = the **issue's behavior spec** (BDD): one row per
   observable behavior (Given/When/Then phrasing where it helps); rows do
   not point at slices — ticket TDD proves units, the end-of-issue review
   walks these behaviors at the real entrypoint. N/A rows need a reason.
8. `tasks.md` **tracer-bullet slices** (to-ticket style): each cuts a complete
   path when it can, but the hard rules are only — declare `Blocked by` edges
   **with an Edge Classification label** (file-overlap | seam-required |
   methodology-order; only seam-required blocks in worktree mode;
   shared mode also blocks file-overlap — ADR 0012), fit a
   **fresh context window** (default ~400 diff lines / ~4 owned files;
   exceeded ⇒ re-cut on the spot), and no two same-wave slices sharing core
   files in shared mode. **Lower bound:** a change that fits one fresh context
   window does not become a multi-slice issue — recommend `rope-quick`
   (ADR 0006) instead. **Two-stage contract slices:** a `Kind: contract` slice
   carrying deep durability/concurrency/protocol semantics is cut as
   thin-interface + hardening (ADR 0011) — consumers block only on the
   thin-interface slice; migration/schema files have exactly one owning
   slice. **Evidence projection:** every slice's Required evidence entries
   cite the matrix rows they prove; a matrix row with no slice evidence is a
   shape defect — fix it here, not at go. Every slice carries a **Demo path**
   field: the behavior you can demo when it lands — never a layer name.
   Component slices (parts of one user story) are legal: briefs cite the story
   row + their own completion criteria. Look for a **prefactor** opportunity
   first — "make the change easy, then make the easy change" — a
   structural-enabling slice that unblocks wide parallel work.
   Wide refactor → expand–contract (gates-and-vocab.md). Anti-pattern catalog:
   gates-and-vocab.md.
   **Seam-migration sweep (ADR 0014):** a slice that moves/renames a shared
   seam (owned files touch a contract other modules consume) carries a
   mandatory **consumer-sweep** Required-evidence entry: old symbol
   `grep`/import-graph assertion over the whole repo (zero hits, or every
   hit accounted for). Blast radius crosses file boundaries — owning the
   seam never owns the consumers, so nobody else will sweep (agent-workbench
   dingtalk v1.6.2: two broken assembly files were in no slice's owned
   files; `reply_queue` residue shipped for 6 days).
   **Shared ledgers (ADR 0014):** appender-style files multiple slices would
   write (`map.md`, registries, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`-style ledgers) are
   excluded from concurrent leaf writes. Leaves **return evidence rows** in
   their final report; the wave integrator appends once. Declaring such a
   file in two same-wave `Owned files` is a shape defect.
   **Composition roots (ADR 0014):** enumerate the repo's assembly points
   the issue touches (channel/CLI/service wiring, DI/route tables, panel
   mounts, local stack bring-up — usually 2–6 per repo). Touched ≥1 ⇒ add a
   `## Composition roots` block to `tasks.md`: one L3 acceptance line per
   root (real assembly, one event in, one observable behavior out; mock
   only at the outer boundary). Harness missing ⇒ a harness slice is cut
   first (Wave 1); harness exists ⇒ the line cites it. E4-style user walks
   demote to final spot-check once L3 rows exist.
9. **Read the graph, then quiz granularity, then ask one question.** Derive
**waves** (topological levels) and **rivers** (clusters with no edge, direct or
transitive, between them) from the `Blocked by` edges
([vocabulary](references/gates-and-vocab.md#frontier-waves-rivers)) — then get the
numbers from the executor instead of by hand: under dynamic
execution the shipped go kernel compiles a plan without spawning anything
(`explain`), so the same code that will schedule the run reports **initial
ready count, level widths, the longest gating chain, and the cross-level
preference edges**. Under agent dispatch, derive them from the edges and say
which numbers are estimates. Show those numbers with
the serial total: a chain of *n* levels is *n* sequential rounds whatever the
window is, and a window wider than the chain buys nothing. Then the
**granularity quiz** (same message, not a new round): any slice too coarse
(won't fit a window) or too fine (trivial grouping lost)? Are the blocking
edges real per their Edge Classification? A `seam-required` edge that does not
carry a consumed contract is a shape defect, not caution — cutting a thin
interface slice or narrowing the consumer's dependency is the fix. Merge or
split? **Then** exactly one execution question:
    - two or more rivers ⇒ offer the **split** — each river its own issue, its
      own pipeline, deliverable alone — or one issue with the rivers running in
      parallel;
    - one chain ⇒ confirm the wave order and go.
    If re-cutting a slice to fit would bend the requirement, stop: take the
    specific misalignment **back to grill** — early grill is cheaper than late
    rework.
10. `e2e.md` carries **real-environment behaviors only** — real external
    systems, real entrypoints, real data the mocks cannot prove (a behavior
    unit-tested against fakes that depends on a real API's semantics
    belongs here). Never list ticket-level test reruns; TDD evidence
    already covers them. L3 composition-root smokes are **not** e2e — they
    are mechanical wave gates (fake transport at the outer boundary) and
    live in the `tasks.md` composition-roots block. Label each item's
    **mechanism** (`browser-walk`/`cli`/`api`/`file-inspect`/
    `judgment`/`credentialed`/`unreachable`); classify executors against
    it (gates-and-vocab), resolving non-agent gates at shape time — go
    re-resolves against the live harness capability probe.
11. **Contract Note gate:** output the `## Contract Note` from `prd.md` (3–5
    one-sentence bullets: “when this issue is done, what can you observe?” +
    failure visibility where relevant). The user confirms the note **instead of
    reading the full PRD**; confirming the note confirms the Behavior Contract,
    because the note is its direct human projection — not a separate wish list.
    Then confirm architecture decisions + gates → commit package.
12. **Done when** package committed, every impact entry has a disposition or
    recorded blocker, and gates are decided. Handoff go in-session
    (issue path + commit); cross-window only if user switches sessions.

## Guardrails

- No feature code; no ready mark if Contract, seams, architecture dispositions,
  conflicts, or facts are open.
- `not-applicable` requires its trigger-check record; it is not a missing section.
- Do not mark a high-risk New decision candidate ready without a decision.
- Do not ask serial-or-parallel before the slice graph exists; the graph answers
  it (step 9), with numbers.
- Do not merge rivers into one slice to dodge the split question.
- Fresh-context fit is an iron rule for every slice, not advice.
- No stale file-by-file plans in PRD — public interfaces and seams only.
- Do not call the PRD a “spec” or slices “tickets” in written artifacts.
- Contract Note must be 3–5 bullets derived from Behavior Contract fields
  (Observable result / Failure visibility / boundary), never a second contract
  that can drift from the PRD.
- Do not ask the user to read the full PRD by default; step 11 confirms the
  Contract Note. Full-PRD review is opt-in.
- A seam-migration slice without a consumer-sweep evidence entry is not
  ready; a touched composition root without an L3 line is not ready.
- Mocks at a migrated seam instead of the outer boundary are a shape defect
  (fiction validation), not a test-style preference.

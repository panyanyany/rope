# Rope Go Execution Rules

## Parent / Leaf Contract

The go session is the **Parent Orchestrator**. Leaf workers:

| Role | Typical preset | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| implementer | `rope-implementer` | TDD, implement one slice unit, commit, return summary + paths |
| reviewer | `rope-reviewer` | End-of-issue behavior acceptance: Matrix walk at the real entrypoint + probe; verdict owner |
| scanner | `rope-explore` + Standards brief | End-of-issue Standards fast-scan: lint/typecheck gate, conventions, smell baseline; never runs the product |
| explore | `rope-explore` | Read-only facts when re-brief needs more context |

Rules:

- Parent spawns leaves with **self-contained briefs**; leaves return
  **summary + artifact paths/status** only.
- **No nested spawn.** Parent owns all dispatch.
- Correction = rewrite brief + re-spawn implementer. Max **2** automated fix
  rounds per problem → Human Escalation Stop. Design/contract defect →
  immediate stop. A fix round never pauses dispatch of other ready slices.
- **Concurrency default**: every ready slice gets a background leaf; a
  single parallel pair still runs in parallel; any serialization needs a
  recorded reason in `tasks.md`.

## Modes

- **Worktree mode** — host can isolate a spawn in a git worktree (pi
  subagents: `isolation: "worktree"`; Claude Code: agent `--worktree`; a
  hand-made worktree works too). Slice-ready: ready = seam-required blockers **merged**;
  dispatch into a fresh worktree from the latest merged HEAD. Overlapping
  slices may run concurrently — overlap surfaces in the merge queue.
- **Shared mode** — waves; same-wave parallelism needs disjoint owned
  files; parallel leaves must not commit simultaneously (index contention):
  the parent collects commits serially in landing order, or leaves stop at
  green + diff and the parent commits.

## Merge queue (worktree mode)

Under dynamic execution the **kernel** owns this queue; the parent reads the
`merged` rows out of the run record. Under agent dispatch the parent runs it.
Either way the rules are the same: landed branches merge **serially, one at a
time**, in landing order, and the parent never merges while a leaf is running
that could touch the same paths.

1. Merge one branch; conflict → re-dispatch **one** implementer leaf with
   both branch names and conflicting paths, resolving **on the unmerged
   branch** (merge/rebase the landed sibling — the unmerged slice's brief
   and commits carry its intent, ADR 0012); its fix rejoins the queue.
   When tasks.md records methodology-order preferences (ADR 0011), order
   the queue by them when convenient — they never gate dispatch, only
   landing order.
2. After each merge: update `map.md` from leaf summaries, re-check the
   ready set, dispatch newly-ready slices.
3. Agent dispatch adds no per-merge test ritual — leaves ran TDD;
   downstream worktrees exercise upstream changes. Dynamic execution uses
   its declared L2/L3 integration checks, not extra full-suite reruns.
   Assembled behavior is accepted at the end-of-issue review. **Flake discipline (ADR 0013):** a failure under
   parallel load → rerun only the failing tests to classify the flake; a
   full clean rerun needs a recorded reason.

## Worktree setup (repo contract, in `routes.md`)

```md
- Worktree setup: `./scripts/worktree-setup.sh`   # or: host-managed | npm ci | uv sync | …
```

- **Declared command** — **check-first and idempotent**: the script begins
  with a cheap testability check (e.g. `test -d node_modules`) and exits
  fast when the worktree is already testable. Prefer cheap strategies over
  reinstalling: read-only symlinks from the main checkout
  (`node_modules`, venvs, `.env*` — the quick-path convention), shared
  package caches (pnpm store). It goes into every worktree leaf's brief as
  **step 0, unconditional** — a precondition, not a repair the leaf decides
  to run after a green failure:
  ```md
  Worktree setup (run first; check-first script, fast no-op when already
  testable): <command>. Environment failure after setup → report blocker;
  never spend fix rounds on environment setup.
  ```
  Running a declared command is mechanics; recognizing an environment
  failure inside test output is judgement — the brief must not depend on
  the latter. A worktree leaf returns one setup line (`setup: ran <cmd>` |
  `setup: no-op (already testable)`); the Return Gate bounces a code-bearing
  slice whose return is missing it.
- **`host-managed`** — a host hook prepares worktrees. State its **scope**:
  hooks firing only for host-created worktrees do not cover rope-spawned
  isolation worktrees — declare the script invoked manually instead
  (usually `bash <host-setup.sh> <path>`). Either way the brief still
  carries step 0 (a no-op check when the hook already ran).
- **Undeclared** — leaf tries green first; environment failure is a
  blocker. Parent falls back to shared mode for remaining slices and
  records the reason. Before accepting any "setup friction" reason to fall
  back, check whether the host setup script applies manually — it usually
  can, keeping worktree mode available.

## Test tiers & baseline ladder (repo contract, ADR 0013)

`routes.md` declares:

```md
- Test tiers: quick: `<cmd>` (~Ns, measured)   # guards + entrypoint smoke + pure units
               full:  `<cmd>` (~Ns, measured)   # regression net, not an iteration tool
               report: `<full cmd> 2>&1 | tee <log> | grep -E '<failure|tally>'`
                       # one run prints the failure names plus the tally and
                       # saves everything; see One run, below
```

- **Impact selection:** shape's Testing Decisions names affected modules,
  shared consumers, focused commands, and reasons for included/excluded
  suites. Slice tests stay focused; integration checks exercise affected
  seams; final review walks the Matrix/E2E and checks assembled impact.
  Expand to broader suites for shared infrastructure, uncertain impact,
  evidence of cross-module coupling, or an explicit repository requirement.
  A local failure is diagnosed before using it to justify a global rerun.
  - **Contract sweep.** The affected set follows what the change *breaks*,
    not what it *touches*. When a slice retires, reverses, renames, or
    re-keys a contract — prompt text, enum or status value, field or
    parameter name, error string, menu entry, response shape — the
    assertions that pin it usually live in files the slice never opens:
    tests exercise public interfaces and rarely import the symbol being
    deleted, so grepping for that symbol returns near zero. Grep the test
    tree for the contract's own vocabulary instead (the literal string, the
    old value, the removed field). Every hit is migrated in this slice or
    named out of scope with a reason. A hand-picked file list is not a
    sweep.
- **Baseline ladder** (go startup): reuse same-HEAD green evidence (CI or
  recorded run ≤24h) that covers the selected scope and relevant environment;
  otherwise run the declared quick tier or affected tests. Broader suites
  are an issue-level fallback only with one of the impact reasons above.
  Record the selected scope, command, reason, and reused/run evidence in
  existing Testing Decisions/work records.
- **One run shows the failures.** Every command used as evidence writes its
  full output to a file and prints the failing item names plus the tally in
  that same invocation. Three projections of one command means running it
  once and reading the file three ways — never three runs. Keep the exit
  status intact through the capture: a bare `cmd | tee log | grep …`
  pipeline reports the grep's status and silently turns a red suite green,
  so `set -o pipefail` first. Recover a stack trace by grepping the saved
  file, never by rerunning the command.
- **Full is a scope, not a frequency.** Baseline and final review are
  decision points, not two mandatory full-suite executions. Scope-green
  proves only that scope. Backend-only local changes do not automatically
  run frontend suites; changes to a shared API consumed by the UI include
  affected UI tests, expanding further when coupling is broad or unknown.
- **Undeclared is legal**: the ladder skips the rung. When shape finds
  the line missing, shape derives it (explore leaf or in-session scan —
  never a human step, never mid-flight invention at go): guards +
  entrypoint smoke mandatory, pure unit tests optional, fixture-heavy
  integration / benchmark / network tests excluded; time the candidate
  and write it back **only if ≤60s**, with date, criteria, and measured
  time. These criteria live here only — shape references, never
  duplicates.

## Leaf Brief Contract (hard budget)

Per ADR 0005: **minimal brief** — allowlist + ≤60-line cap (paths and
command blocks excluded). The parent checks the budget before dispatch.

**Content payload (allowed inline):**

1. Issue path + slice id/title
2. **Public behavior:** one user-visible sentence — or, for a component
   slice, the user-story row it serves + its own completion criteria
   (interface signature / tests green)
3. **Behavior Contract:** the 6 fields cut to their thinnest form
4. **Architecture constraints (by reference):** Constraint Bundle **path**
   + slice **Constraint IDs** + short global invariant list
5. **Test seam + prior art:** the seam from PRD Testing Decisions + one
   prior-art path

**Operational contract (required, not counted as content):**

- TDD mode: `required` (default for code) | `waived (docs-only)` + reason;
  when required — red command(s) + what counts as red, green command(s)
  after minimal implementation — focused seam commands by default; a
  full-suite run is issue-level evidence (ADR 0013), never a brief
  requirement
- Expected return shape: summary, paths changed, delivery branch + the commit
  hash printed by `git rev-parse HEAD`, acceptance text exercised, red evidence
  (command + failure) unless waived, green evidence, constraint IDs
  checked + disposition conflicts, falsified/needed map lines (worktree
  mode), blockers with a class, one setup line in worktree mode
  (`setup: ran <cmd>` | `setup: no-op`) — **plus the Return Gate payload:**
  every slice Required-evidence item mapped to pasted command output or an
  artifact path, keyed by evidence id (ADR 0011)
- Worktree mode, dynamic: the kernel injects the delivery contract, so the
  parent does not write it — commit everything, leave `git status --porcelain`
  empty, then `git branch -f <delivery branch> HEAD` as the last write. A leaf
  that misses a step costs a flag (`recovered` / `moved` in the delivery
  verdict), never the implementation. Worktree mode, agent dispatch: state the
  same three steps in the brief, because the host's own `pi-agent-<id>` cleanup
  branch is not a name the plan can route on.
- Relevant artifact paths (prd/tasks/e2e, bundle, map, specs, files)
- Map path — orient by it; update falsified lines before commit (shared
  mode) or report them in the summary (worktree mode)
- Worktree mode: the worktree-setup step-0 command when the repo declares
  one (unconditional; check-first script)
- No nested spawn; commit rules; Blocked by / Scope

End-of-issue briefs (two, ADR 0010): **scanner** — diff + commit list +
standards-source paths + inline global invariants + pasted smell baseline
(below); **reviewer** — diff + commit list + Matrix behavior rows + e2e
path + entrypoint start hint + inline global invariants (bundle path on
suspected conflict only; no map). Axes and high-risk list live in the
reviewer preset body, not the brief. Same allowlist and line cap.

## Return Gate reconciliation & Defense Budget (ADR 0011)

On each landing, reconcile mechanically — a table check, not a review:

```md
| Evidence item (id) | Required by (matrix row) | Returned output/path | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S2-E1 crash-after-rename | B4 | pasted pytest output | ok |
| S2-E2 concurrent get-or-create | B5 | (missing) | BOUNCE |
```

- Any `BOUNCE` row → re-dispatch the leaf with exactly the missing item
  ids; nothing else reopens.
- The gate never re-reads implementations, never reruns tests, never
  issues verdicts — the end-of-issue review stays the only review gate
  (ADR 0007). A missing evidence item bounces the **leaf**; the parent
  never runs tests to back-fill a leaf's evidence (ADR 0013).
- **Defense Budget:** a correction brief contains **zero** acceptance
  requirements absent from the Behavior Matrix. A gap discovered
  mid-execution goes back to shape as a re-cut (new slice) or is demoted
  to a recorded non-blocking note in tasks.md. Design-constraint drift
  across rounds ("fix2 replaces what fix1 built") is a Defense Budget
  violation — stop and re-cut instead.

## Human Gate Panel (ADR 0011)

Multiple pending gates render once, batched:

```md
## Human Gate Panel (2 pending)
1. [S5] authorize fail-open → fail-closed switch — blast radius: summary
   gate path; lanes S2/S3 continue, S4 holds.
2. [S8] approve destructive worktree cleanup — blast radius: none unmerged;
   all lanes continue.
```

Each entry: affected slices / exact authorization requested / blast radius /
other lanes' continue-or-hold status. Never present gates one-at-a-time while
other lanes sit idle without an explicit hold statement.

## End-of-Issue Review Execution

After all slices and before verify. Under dynamic execution the **kernel** owns
this gate (ADR 0014) — freeze point, both axes, mechanical aggregation and the
bounded fix loop — and the parent only reads the record. Under agent dispatch
the parent runs it: spawns **two read-only leaves in one message** (ADR 0010),
both new eyes, never watched the build, then does bookkeeping from the
structured return and renders an exhausted fix budget as the Human Escalation
Stop:

1. **Scanner leaf** — the `rope-explore` preset with the Standards brief
   below (generic read-only worker otherwise; record the type used).
   Runs impact-selected lint/typecheck/build first and skips what tooling enforces;
   never runs the product.
2. **Reviewer leaf** — `rope-reviewer` from the harness manifest (generic
   worker with explicit review instructions otherwise). Read-only on
   code; the **only** leaf allowed to start/stop processes and drive a
   browser. Starts the product first, reads the diff while it boots.
3. **Aggregate mechanically**: verdict = worst of axis verdicts
   (`approve` < `changes_requested` < `blocked`); blocking findings from
   either leaf → one fix brief. No rerank, no merge, no re-judgment —
   the parent is not a second reviewer. Record verdict + both leaf
   identities + fix rounds in `tasks.md`.
4. **Fix protocol**: the fix brief transcribes blocking findings verbatim
   — `{severity, path:line, issue, fix}` — nothing left to explore.
   ≤2 automated rounds, then Human Escalation Stop. `note` findings are
   recorded in `tasks.md`, never fixed by a round.
5. **Delta re-review**: after a fix round, the scanner re-scans the fix
   commit diff only; the reviewer re-probes only affected paths. A full
   re-review never repeats.

### Diff hygiene (both leaves)

```md
git diff <base>...HEAD -- . ':(exclude)*lock*' ':(exclude)*.snap' ':(exclude)dist/'
```

Extend the excludes per repo (vendor/, build output, generated files) —
lockfile/snapshot noise is 20–50 % of a web project's assembled diff, and
both leaves pay for every included line.

### Scanner brief (paste, ~35 lines)

- diff command (with excludes) + commit list
- standards-source paths (CODING_STANDARDS / CONTRIBUTING / lint config)
- inline global invariants (short list from the bundle)
- the smell baseline below, pasted verbatim
- return contract: "Report `clean` or findings, ≤200 words, each
  `{severity blocking|note, path:line, issue, fix}`. Every hit is a
  judgement call, never a violation; documented repo standards override
  the baseline; skip what tooling enforces."

**Smell baseline** (Fowler, _Refactoring_ ch.3, one line each; plus rope's
TDD anti-patterns: implementation-coupled, tautological, bulk-horizontal):

- Mysterious Name — the name doesn't say what it does → rename; no honest name means murky design
- Duplicated Code — same logic shape in >1 hunk → extract the shared shape
- Feature Envy — method reaches into another's data more than its own → move it there
- Data Clumps — same fields/params travel together → bundle into one type
- Primitive Obsession — a primitive stands in for a domain concept → give the concept a type
- Repeated Switches — same switch/if-cascade recurs → polymorphism or one shared map
- Shotgun Surgery — one change scattered across many files → gather into one module
- Divergent Change — one module edited for unrelated reasons → split by reason
- Speculative Generality — hooks the spec doesn't need → delete, inline back
- Message Chains — long `a.b().c().d()` walks → hide behind one method
- Middle Man — mostly delegates onward → cut it, call the target
- Refused Bequest — implementer ignores most of what it inherits → compose instead

### Reviewer brief

- diff command (same excludes) + commit list
- Matrix behavior rows + e2e path
- entrypoint start hint: the project's documented start command when one
  exists; otherwise the leaf derives it from the README
- inline global invariants + bundle path (read only on suspected conflict)
- no map; no upfront bundle read; axes and high-risk focus live in the
  reviewer preset body

## High-risk boundaries (the reviewer's deepest look)

- public interface or user-visible behavior
- external system or adapter behavior
- auth, permission, secret, or data leak risk
- persistence, schema, migration, stored format
- routing, app entrypoint, runtime wiring, background worker
- multi-layer behavior; E2E critical path

## E2E Execution Statuses

e2e.md carries **real-environment behaviors only** (real APIs, real
entrypoints, real external systems). Ticket-level units live in TDD
evidence, never in e2e.md.

Executor resolution is capability-relative (gates-and-vocab): read each
item's mechanism label, probe the harness tool surface, and run every
covered mechanism as agent. A user handing an item over mid-go
(“你自己跑吧”) is the probe firing late — run it and record it as agent
execution with evidence, never as an exception.

**The resolution is written into the plan before dispatch.** The kernel runs
no probe and asks no human, so each e2e item carries `executor`
(`agent` | `agent-with-gate` | `user` | `not-run`) plus its `decision`, and the
plan is rejected when the two disagree — a gated action cannot start without a
recorded `approved`. An item that runs must name its `preset`. An item that
does not run must carry the `reason` it does not, and is recorded with its
terminal status rather than dropped: a skipped item and a missing item must not
look the same in the record.

Only an item the agent actually ran gates. A required item kept out of the run
(`user`, `not-run`, a declined gate) is an honest terminal outcome the run may
still deliver with; a leaf that *ran* and reported `blocked` has not passed.

- `agent_passed`: agent ran it; record command + evidence.
- `agent_failed`: ran and failed; fix or record blocker.
- `blocked_on_gate` / `blocked_on_user`: missing approval / human-only
  (judgment, credentialed, unreachable).
- `skipped_by_user_at_shape` / `not_run_with_reason`: intentional skips.

## Commit Rules

- Commit each completed slice independently; commit review fixes
  independently; do not combine unrelated slices; never push/merge/rebase
  unless asked.

## Handoff Checklist

- Per-slice commits present; the end-of-issue review verdict (+ fix
  rounds) recorded with identity; e2e statuses terminal; no unrelated
  dirty files.

---

## Fault manual (read on failure, not upfront)

**No harness presets** (`~/.config/rope/harness/<host>.json` or `rope-*`
agents missing): use a generic host worker without model pin; record
`preset_missing` in `tasks.md`; continue. Never auto-run
`rope-harness-presets`; never hard-block.

**Cannot background-spawn**: run waves foreground, one leaf at a time;
record the reason in the parallelism declaration.

**Worktree requested but result carries no branch name / copy toplevel**:
the host downgraded to a shared-checkout run — record the downgrade and
hold shared-mode discipline for the rest of the issue.

**Cannot spawn any reviewer worker at all**: self-review and record
`review_degraded: no_subagent_tool_available` + what was attempted + why
self-review. Never silently skip review when a worker can be spawned; never
instruct an implementer leaf to spawn the reviewer.

**Leaf truncated / aborted mid-work**: probe git status + test state before
re-dispatch; recover uncommitted work or reset, then re-brief.

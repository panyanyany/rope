# Rope

**Grill. Shape. Go.**

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A repo-local skill harness for agentic coding tools — spec-driven,
graph-driven, and honest about what "done" means.

## What is Rope

Rope is a set of small skills + a `.rope/` knowledge layer that turns one
messy feature request into shipped, verified work. It exists because agent
sessions fail in two familiar ways: **long-session drift** (the agent forgets
what it decided three hours ago) and **green-pipeline rot** (every test
passes, the product is still broken — nobody started it for real).

Rope answers both. Durable knowledge lives in files, not chat. Heavy work
runs in fresh-context leaf workers, orchestrated by one lean parent. And
nothing is called done until a reviewer with **new eyes** walks the **real
entrypoint** — starting the product the way a user would.

Works with any host that supports skills and subagents (pi, Claude Code,
codex, agy, …); `rope-harness-presets` discovers the active host's agent
mechanism and model catalog at run time and writes leaf presets in that
host's native format — no hardcoded adapters. Go's execution form is
config-decided (ADR 0014): `~/.rope/config.toml` `[execution] default =
"dynamic"` runs slices through a script-driven deterministic workflow where
the host supports it (pi SubagentWorkflow), with L1/L2/L3 mechanical gates;
absent, or on hosts without a runner, go uses parent dispatch unchanged.

## How it works

One issue, one parent session, five moves:

1. **Grill** — a plain-language interview that settles behavior and
   architecture *before* planning. Decisions land in `.rope/` docs
   immediately; chat is treated as volatile.
2. **Shape** — requirements become an issue package: PRD with a
   **Contract Note** (3–5 observable outcomes), tracer-bullet slices sized
   to a fresh context window (component and prefactor slices legal), and a
   behavior matrix as the issue's BDD spec. Then shape **reads the slice
   graph** — rivers, sizes, numbers — and asks you exactly one execution
   question.
3. **Go** — two modes by host capability. **Worktree mode** (host can
   isolate a spawn): slice-ready scheduling — a slice starts in its own
   worktree the moment its blockers merge, no wave barrier; a serial merge
   queue lands branches one at a time. **Shared mode** (any host): waves
   with disjoint owned files. Leaves orient by a shared investigation
   **map** and commit slice by slice. TDD discipline lives here, at agreed
   seams.
4. **Review (once)** — after all slices, two parallel read-only leaves
   that never watched the build: a cheap scanner fast-scans the diff for
   standards and smells while the reviewer starts the product and walks
   the behavior Matrix at the real entrypoint. Blocking findings route to
   one fix brief, max two rounds, then it stops and asks you.
5. **Verify & finish** — verify is a thin paperwork gate (review recorded,
   E2E terminal, tree clean); finish closes the issue and routes
   architecture-doc updates home.

Small task that fits one fresh context window — fix with the diagnosis done,
or a small feature? Skip all of it: `rope-quick` is
the solo path — red → green at the nearest seam, one page of record, four
stop lines back to the full pipeline.

## What makes it different

| Idea | What it buys you |
| --- | --- |
| **The graph answers, not vibes** | Serial-vs-parallel is decided *after* slicing, from `Blocked by` edges, with numbers. Zero-dependency "rivers" get offered as splits. |
| **Slice-ready worktrees** | With host isolation, a slice runs the moment its blockers merge — the graph itself is the scheduler, waves never existed. One `worktree-setup:` line makes each fresh copy testable. |
| **Contract Note** | You confirm 3–5 observable bullets instead of reading a PRD. The note *is* the contract's human projection — never a second contract. |
| **Fresh-context iron rule** | Every slice fits one clean context window. Oversized slices are re-cut at shape; a re-cut that bends the requirement goes back to grill. |
| **One review, new eyes** | Per-slice reviews see per-slice problems. The failure classes that kill issues — cross-slice conflicts, spec-observable gaps, fixture-vs-product drift — only show at the assembled diff. The budget goes there. |
| **Real entrypoint probe** | Fixture-green is not product-true. The reviewer starts the product — browser, CLI, or API, whatever the project ships — and walks the primary paths. |
| **Investigation map** | One fact per line, path + date. Leaves stop re-finding the same code (in our field data, 56–71% of big-slice tool calls were wayfinding). |
| **Architecture continuity** | Every issue records a disposition — inherit, extend, supersede — for each ADR it touches, and hands leaves a Constraint Bundle by reference. |
| **Thin verify** | Paperwork only. It never re-judges code; it checks the gate really closed. |

## How our thinking evolved

- **2026-06-27 · ADR 0001** — Verify splits from go as its own gate; parent/leaf roles get names.
- **2026-08-05 · ADR 0002** — Decisions get dispositions; issues inherit, extend, or supersede recorded architecture — never silently.
- **2026-08-11 · ADR 0003** — First parallelism: an opt-in "dynamic mode" with disjoint file ownership. (Later superseded.)
- **2026-08-17 · ADR 0004** — Review goes risk-tiered per-slice/batch; leaf briefs get a hard budget (≤60 lines, allowlist).
- **2026-08-19 · ADR 0005/0006** — Humans confirm a Contract Note, not a PRD; small fixes get a solo quick path.
- **2026-08-22 · ADR 0007** — A 7.5-hour all-green session shipped a broken product. Execution turns graph-driven; review collapses to one new-eyes gate with a real-entrypoint probe; verify goes thin.

## Install

```bash
# into the default agent skills directory
npx git+https://github.com/WufeiHalf/rope.git add

# or project-local
npx git+https://github.com/WufeiHalf/rope.git add --target ./.agents/skills
```

Both targets receive the full skill set, including shared runtime references.
Dynamic startup instructions resolve relative to the loaded skill, not the
managed repo's `.rope/` directory. Updating the CLI alone does not refresh
already copied skills; explicitly run `add` for the intended target. If the
host finds duplicate skill names, check which path it loaded before updating.

Then, in the repo you want to manage:

```bash
rope-init        # scaffold .rope/ (CONTEXT, routes, adr, specs, …)
```

Optional, once per machine or model-catalog change:

```bash
rope-harness-presets   # write rope-* leaf presets for your host
```

Missing presets never block — go/verify soft-degrade and record it.

## Skills

| Skill | Job |

| `rope-init` | Scaffold `.rope/` in a target repository |
| `rope-grill` | Plain-language requirement interview; decisions land in durable docs |
| `rope-shape` | Issue package: PRD + Contract Note, slices, matrix, E2E, graph read |
| `rope-go` | Wave execution, investigation map, TDD at seams, per-slice commits; config-decided workflow execution (ADR 0014) |
| `rope-verify` | Thin paperwork gate between go and finish |
| `rope-finish` | Close the issue; route architecture-doc updates |
| `rope-summary` | Preserve reusable contracts/learnings into `.rope/` after the fact |
| `rope-clear` | Propose and apply approved cleanup of stale docs; retain decision history |
| `rope-quick` | Solo single-window path (fixes + small features): grill-lite, stop lines back to the pipeline |
| `rope-harness-presets` | Bind leaf roles to harness-native presets for your host |
